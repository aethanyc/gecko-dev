.item {
  grid-row: 2 / span 1;
  background: green;

  Flexible row track sizing is resolved in two passes:

  The first pass:
   - The only grid item has a max-content height of 100px, which is also the
     hypothetical fr size.
   - Initially, each flexible track (0.4fr) is given a hypothetical size of
     100px * 0.4 = 40px.
   - This makes the grid container's hypothetical height 40px * 2 = 80px.

  The second pass:
   - With the container height now fixed at 80px, the available grid space
     is known.
   - According to the CSS Grid spec (see ยง12.7.1), the hypothetical fr size
     is 80 * max(0.4 * 2 , 1.0) = 80px.
   - In this pass, each 0.4fr row track resolves to 80px * 0.4 = 32px in height.
